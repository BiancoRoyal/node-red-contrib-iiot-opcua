## The IoT/IIoT OPC UA toolbox package for [Node-RED][3] based on [node-opcua][4].

This is an updated version of the project of the same name, which was deprecated by the [original developer][1] in April 2020. 
The original repository has been deleted from Github, so this is based on [this fork of a slightly outdated version of the project](https://github.com/cacamille3/node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua).* 
This project upgrades the original work by migrating to TypeScript, and updating dependencies, including updates to new major release versions of Node-RED (v0.19 to v2.2.2) and node-opcua (v0.4 to v2.64.1).

* tested with Node.js v14.19 and Node-RED v2.2.2
* based on node-opcua v2.64 (OPC UA v1.03)
* extendable with node-opcua-isa95

*The latest version published to NPM was 3.12.1, while our version is based on 3.10.2.

## Installing

1. Navigate to your Node-RED data directly. This defaults to `$HOME/.node-red/`
2. Install via npm.
   ```shell
   npm install node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua
   ```

## Migrating from previous versions

The update from v3.x to v4.x changed the way some nodes are implemented.

### General Changes
- The message format was standardized. While in older versions, a lot of additional properties were placed directly into the message,
they have been moved into the message's payload (`msg.payload`). This is to ensure the standard Node-RED message format is used, where the message
itself may only contain an ID, a topic, and a payload. This means that any references like `msg.nodetype` should be changed to `msg.payload.nodetype`.

### Browser
- The option `singleBrowseResult` has been replaced with `multipleOutputs`, and the default value now combines all outputs into one message. To maintain the same output, replace `singleBrowseResult` with `multipleOutputs` and swap the corresponding boolean value (true becomes false, false becomes true).

### Flex-Server
- The `node-opcua` library is now directly accessible as `opcua`. This means all references to `coreServer.core.nodeOPCUA` should be replaced with `opcua`.
- `node.iiot.assert` is no longer accessible. The functionality can be replaced by using an `if` statement that throws a new error (`if (errorConfition) throw new Error('Error Message'`). Errors can be displayed by using a `catch` node connected to a `debug` node, which displys the entire message.


## Contributing

Every bit helps! If you come across any bugs, please [send a buge report](https://github.com/DATATRONiQ/node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua/issues/new?type=bug), or if you feel inclined to fix it yourself, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/DATATRONiQ/node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua/compare).

### Setting up local development
1. Ensure you are using node 14. This has been developed using node v14.19.1. If using Node Version Manager: `nvm install v14.19.1`
2. Install Node-RED to a separate directory.
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:node-red/node-red.git
   cd node-red
   git checkout tags/2.2.2
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run start # This must be run once to initialize the ~/.node-red directory
   ```
3. Clone this repository into its own directry
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:DATATRONiQ/node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua.git
   cd node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua
   git checkout development
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
4. Add `node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua` to Node-RED
   ```shell
   cd ~/.node-red
   npm install <...>/node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua
   ```
5. Start Node-RED
   ```shell
   cd <...>/node-red
   npm run staart
   ``` 

### :warning: After making changes, remember to run `npm run build` in the `node-red-contrib-iiot-opcua` directory starting Node-RED! :warning:

### Debug

To increase the verbosity of logging, enable debug modes and verbose logging.

Start debug with Node-RED in verbose (-v) mode to get a verbose logging:

    DEBUG=opcuaIIoT* npm run start -v 1>nodeREDIIoTOPCUA.log 2>&1

## Examples
### Basic Flow
![Flow Example](images/wiki/browser-listener-flow3-active.png)

### Your own address space model!

With the flex server you could create your own information model with the OPC UA address space.

![Flex server Example](images/wiki/flexServerAddressSapceExamplev3.png)

### Learn with the examples!

The server node contains demo objects and variables
to start playing with OPC UA method call, read and write operations.

see Node-RED menu (right upper corner) -> Import -> Examples -> iiot opcua

**... secure reading from OPC UA servers with your own key pairs ...**

![Read Example](images/wiki/read-history3-active.png)

**... and secure writing and moving data between OPC UA servers ...**

![Write Example](images/wiki/write-flow3-active.png)

**... create your own variables and objects from events ...**
